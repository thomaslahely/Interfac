My prior education was a rich, formative experience, marked by several positive aspects that I particularly appreciated. First, the course content was relevant and well-structured, which allowed me to acquire solid knowledge in my field of study. The guidance provided by the instructors was also a very positive aspect; they were accessible, attentive, and always ready to help when needed. In addition, the teaching methods used, such as group work and practical projects, fostered active and collaborative learning. The overall atmosphere within the institution was friendly and stimulating, which helped create an environment conducive to personal and academic development.

However, despite these positive aspects, there are certain areas that could be improved. For example, the workload was sometimes excessive, which made it difficult to manage time between studies and other responsibilities. In addition, some subjects could have benefited from a more interactive approach, with more opportunities for students to participate actively in class discussions. Finally, access to resources, such as libraries and laboratories, could be optimized to better meet students’ needs.

As for the difficulties encountered, I sometimes faced challenges related to stress management, particularly during exam periods. Moreover, there were times when communication between students and the administration was not optimal, which could lead to misunderstandings or frustrations. Finally, some courses lacked clarity in their objectives, which made it difficult to understand what was expected.

In conclusion, my previous educational experience was overall positive, with many enriching aspects. However, it is important to recognize the areas where improvements can be made to optimize the experience of future students. This critical reflection will allow me to approach my Master’s with a more informed perspective and a willingness to learn and continually improve.
