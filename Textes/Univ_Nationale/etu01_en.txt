Looking back on my Bachelor’s degree in Computer Science at the University of Le Havre, I feel a deep sense of satisfaction 
regarding the knowledge and skills I have acquired over the years. This program allowed me to strengthen solid foundations 
in my field while developing transversal qualities such as autonomy, rigor, and teamwork. I particularly appreciated the 
diversity of the courses offered, which provided me with a comprehensive understanding of the discipline, as well as the 
commitment of certain teachers who made the lessons engaging and stimulating. The overall atmosphere, both within the 
student groups and with the teaching staff, also helped make these formative years enjoyable and motivating.

However, not everything was without difficulty. Some courses sometimes seemed too theoretical, lacking concrete practical 
work or direct professional applications. I would have appreciated more collaborative projects or workshops to better 
connect theory with real-world situations. Moreover, administrative organization and communication between students and 
teachers could have been improved, as important information was occasionally shared late or unclearly.

I also experienced moments of doubt and fatigue, particularly during exam periods or internships when the workload could 
become quite demanding. These moments, though challenging, taught me to manage my time more effectively and to strengthen 
my resilience in the face of constraints. They also highlighted the importance of academic guidance and support, which 
could have been further developed to help students overcome these challenges.

Overall, these three years have been both enriching and formative, despite some limitations. They have allowed me to 
better understand my strengths, identify areas for improvement, and define my future goals more clearly. I see this 
experience as an essential step in my personal and academic growth, providing a solid foundation to begin my Master’s 
studies with maturity, motivation, and critical thinking.
