Retrospective - IUT - ENGLISH

From 2022 to 2025, I was a student at the IUT of Vannes in the Computer Science bachelor’s program (BUT). Choosing this path felt natural, since I’ve been interested in computing ever since I was a kid. With a general high school diploma focused on Mathematics and Computer Science, it was obvious for me to continue in this field. The IUT was close to my family home, which meant I could go back to my parents quite often. Since the BUT degree is equivalent to a bachelor’s and offered the promise of a work-study program, it was decided that I would study there, instead of going for a regular computer science bachelor’s degree or moving to a distant city. 

The IUT itself was in fairly good shape, definitely better maintained than the rest of the campus. It had a main building (Building B), a smaller one for language classes (Building A), and three amphitheaters of different sizes. In the first year, we often had classes in Amphi A, which had the largest capacity—fitting for the 2022 class of over a hundred students. Later on, we used Amphis B and C more, with C being barely bigger than a regular classroom. 

The courses covered a wide range of subjects. Of course, most of them were computer science-related. In the first year, the main programming language was Java, but throughout the three years we also studied Python, PHP, JavaScript, SQL, and even C++, not to mention technologies like WordPress or Neo4J. There were also more general subjects like English, communication, management, and “Personal and Professional Project.” Finally, there was the specialization track: in the BUT program, several paths are available, and I chose “Application Development: design, programming, testing – AI focus.” The associated project was to build an AI that could classify objects in pictures. In our group, we had to create a fish classification AI using the YOLO model, able to tell apart sharks, jellyfish, and other fish. 

As for the teachers, they had very diverse profiles. Some came from abroad with more than eight years of study behind them, while others had just graduated from the IUT and returned as teachers. On the whole, the professors were competent, but it wasn’t rare for some of them to go off on unexpected tangents—like the English teacher who would spend half an hour talking about Trump, or the PPP teacher who once showed up 40 minutes late because she had gone to get coffee. On the other hand, we also had very dedicated teachers who truly wanted us to learn and gave their all in their courses. 

In the end, even though it took me way too long to find my work-study placement, I still have good memories of my three years at the IUT of Vannes. There were some controversies and some stricter teachers than others… but overall, it was a meaningful and positive experience.
