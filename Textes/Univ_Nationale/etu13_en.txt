The program I followed over the past few years was the Bachelor’s degree in Computer Science (BUT Informatique). This program was extremely rewarding and allowed me to acquire a solid foundation in many areas of computer science. It provided me with both technical skills and a rigorous work methodology, as well as a better ability to collaborate with other students on group projects.
During the first year of the program, we studied the fundamentals of computer science, ranging from algorithmics to the creation of relational databases. These theoretical and practical bases formed an essential foundation for the rest of our learning. Then, with this knowledge, we were able to take on more complex projects, such as developing games with specific code structure constraints and applying the principles of object-oriented programming. These projects allowed me to put my knowledge into practice while developing my logic and creativity.
In the second year, we had the opportunity to work on particularly interesting web projects, which allowed us to discover a large part of the developer’s profession. One of the most significant projects was the design of an unofficial website for the Olympic Games opening ceremony. This ambitious and demanding project taught us how to organize ourselves as a team, communicate effectively, and work with professional tools. To monitor our progress, we used the agile method, which helped us structure our work and move forward iteratively. On the technical side, we developed the back-end in Node.js with a PostgreSQL database, while for the front-end, we used Vue.js. This experience allowed me to understand how a modern framework works and to acquire concrete skills in full-stack web development.
The academic supervision throughout my studies was generally very good. Having the same professors over several years ensured regular follow-up and good consistency in learning. There was also a good atmosphere within the institution, both among teachers and among students. We all knew each other, which contributed to creating a pleasant and motivating environment, conducive to teamwork and mutual support.
Group or individual projects were among the aspects I appreciated the most in this program, as they allowed real progress through practice. These concrete projects confronted us with situations similar to those encountered in professional settings: time management, task distribution, code integration, or solving technical problems. This strengthened my adaptability and confidence in my skills.
However, the third year was a bit disappointing. Unlike the previous years, it contained fewer new topics. Some courses seemed more repetitive or less stimulating, probably due to the transition from the DUT to the BUT, which extended the program from two to three years. Nevertheless, I believe this adjustment phase is temporary and that the curriculum will become more consistent in the coming years.
Finally, the negative points I could mention mainly concern the distribution of the workload. It was often concentrated over short periods, leading to particularly intense weeks that were sometimes difficult to manage. This organization could create some stress and left less time to go deeper into certain subjects. A better balance of projects and assessments throughout the semester would, in my opinion, improve the equilibrium between learning, practice, and rest.
Overall, this program provided me with a solid and formative experience, preparing me to pursue more specialized studies such as a Master’s degree in Artificial Intelligence. It confirmed my strong interest in computer science and gave me the motivation to keep learning, experimenting, and taking on new challenges.
