After obtaining my general baccalaureate with specializations in mathematics, physics-chemistry, and life and earth sciences, I chose to enroll in a Computer Science BUT program. This choice came naturally to me after discovering programming in high school, through workshops offered by my school. These initial experiences allowed me to understand the extent to which computer science combines logic, creativity, and problem-solving: aspects that immediately fascinated me.
The three years of the BUT allowed me to develop solid theoretical and practical skills.
• The first year was devoted to acquiring the fundamentals of computer science: algorithms, Python programming, databases, systems architecture, and networks. This period of general learning gave me an overview of the field and allowed me to experiment with different aspects of the profession. It also allowed me to determine what attracted me most and what I preferred among all these fields, as well as the subjects that interested me less. • In my second year, I chose to specialize in the "Data Management, Administration, and Operations" program. This program allowed me to deepen my knowledge of data analysis and processing, statistics, Python programming, and machine learning. I also learned how to manipulate large volumes of data, clean it, structure it, and extract actionable information for decision-making.
• In my third year, I completed a work-study program, which gave me the opportunity to put my skills into practice in a professional environment. This experience was particularly enriching: it allowed me to learn how to manage real-life projects, collaborate with a team, and understand the demands of the business world. The work-study program also allowed me to strengthen my technical skills while developing transferable qualities such as autonomy, rigor, and communication. I also learned new things in class, particularly by deepening my knowledge of artificial intelligence and databases. We were asked to present various projects we had completed, which allowed us to gain insight into the entire data analysis process.

I am therefore satisfied with my three years spent in the Computer Science BUT program. The supervision offered suited me very well because it required me to be diligent. However, some professors were less pedagogical than others, and their working methods didn't necessarily meet my expectations, which may have affected my skills in certain subjects.
Today, this program has allowed me to acquire a comprehensive education combining theory, practice, and professional experience. It has confirmed my decision to pursue the field of artificial intelligence, a constantly evolving sector where I hope to continue to progress and develop my expertise, particularly through the master's program I have just completed.
