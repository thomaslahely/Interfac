Taking a step back on my journey before starting my Master’s, I realize how formative and structuring my years of study have been. My time at the IUT was an enriching experience that allowed me to develop a solid technical foundation while exposing me to the realities of teamwork and project management. I learned to balance rigor and creativity, particularly through various projects.

I particularly appreciated the balance between theory and practice. The technical courses—ranging from web development and databases to software development—were well grounded in practical use cases. The instructors were approachable and encouraging, creating an environment conducive to curiosity and autonomy. This approach motivated me to go further, especially with CROUStillant, a project designed to automatically centralize the menus of all university restaurants in France and overseas from millions of stored data points, currently used by thousands of students.

The first year of my work-study program at Moët Hennessy was also a key milestone in my journey. Working in a large international group allowed me to confront my technical skills with real-world, large-scale challenges. I participated in a variety of projects, ranging from optimizing logistics flows to designing and developing innovative new tools. This experience taught me to adapt to demanding contexts, communicate effectively with diverse teams, and meet strict deadlines, all while maintaining rigor and precision.

Finally, like any demanding path, this journey came with challenges: a sometimes heavy workload, managing stress under tight deadlines, and learning to organize myself effectively. Yet these challenges proved to be invaluable lessons, helping me gain autonomy, perseverance, and confidence.

Overall, this pre-Master’s experience laid a solid foundation for my professional identity. It allowed me to confirm my passion for development and data, while strengthening my desire to learn and innovate in future projects.
