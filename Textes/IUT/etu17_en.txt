After obtaining my baccalaureate in engineering sciences in 2021, I chose to continue my studies in the same field by enrolling in the CUPGE Science for Engineering program at EiSINe in Charleville-Mézières. This program, equivalent to a bachelor’s degree enhanced with additional courses, was designed as an integrated preparatory course combining theory and high academic standards. I appreciated, at first, the rigor of the program, the accessibility of the instructors, and the stimulating and serious learning environment. These initial months allowed me to strengthen my scientific foundations and to understand the level of rigor expected in higher education.

However, the very demanding pace and heavy workload gradually made the program difficult to follow. Despite my efforts, I fell behind, which led me to reconsider my options. I then joined the standard Science for Engineering bachelor’s program, hoping for a setting more suited to my learning pace. Unfortunately, the university format—with large lecture halls and limited individual support—did not align with my preferred learning style. The content, highly theoretical and general, lacked practical application and connection to professional contexts. It was at this point that I realized I was more drawn to a concrete and applied approach to science and technology.

This reflection led me to apply for the Bachelor of Technology in Computer Science (BUT Informatique) at IUT de Reims, a more professional and structured program. From the beginning, I noticed a real difference: the courses were better supervised, instructors were available and attentive, and tutorials and project-based work offered a much more dynamic learning environment. I particularly appreciated the project-based teaching, which allowed me to understand concepts through practical cases, as well as the collaborative and motivating work atmosphere. The balance between theory and practice enabled me to develop solid skills in programming, algorithms, database management, and web development.

The internships I completed as part of the BUT program were also a major highlight of my academic path. These real-world experiences allowed me to apply my knowledge in professional contexts, understand how teams operate, and gain firsthand exposure to the workplace. I worked on diverse projects, enhanced my autonomy, and developed problem-solving skills while consolidating my technical abilities. These experiences were particularly enriching and motivating, as they gave me a clear insight into careers in computer science and artificial intelligence and confirmed my decision to pursue this field.

Looking back, my academic journey included challenging moments but also many personal lessons. The obstacles I faced, especially during my first years after high school, taught me perseverance and the importance of a learning environment suited to my needs. If I were to mention areas for improvement in the programs I attended, I would highlight the lack of personalized support and the occasional disconnect between theoretical courses and professional realities. In contrast, I found the BUT program to offer a balanced, more human, and motivating teaching model.

Overall, I have a positive view of my academic path. Even though my journey has not been linear, each stage has contributed to shaping my project. These experiences have helped me understand myself better, gain maturity, and confirm my passion for computer science and artificial intelligence. Today, I feel ready to pursue a Master’s program with renewed motivation, a clear vision of my objectives, and a genuine desire to deepen my expertise in a field I am passionate about.
