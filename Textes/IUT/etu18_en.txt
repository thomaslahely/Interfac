I am currently studying for a Master's degree in AI in Reims at URCA (University of Reims Champagne-Ardenne). I also hold a Bachelor's degree in Computer Science specializing in DATA, also from URCA. My studies allow me to deepen my knowledge in the field of computer science, particularly in programming, website development, database creation/administration, network theory, and deployment methods for production. I also took private lessons in computer science during middle school and high school. I was able to learn the basics of C, Python, VM creation, container creation with Docker, and VM management with Ansible. For now, I am enjoying the courses I have taken as part of my master's degree/BUT/private lessons. They have been extremely useful throughout my studies thanks to the knowledge I have gained, as well as in my professional experiences and internships. However, I did encounter some difficulties, particularly with advanced concepts such as applied mathematics and optimization. The workload in the master's program, combined with group projects and work-study programs, can sometimes be difficult to manage, especially during exam periods. Finally, internships can be complicated, especially when searching for available companies.
