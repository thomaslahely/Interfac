During my Bachelor of Technology in Computer Science at the IUT of Reims, I had the opportunity to acquire a wide range of skills that allowed me to broaden my knowledge in the fields of development and programming. I particularly appreciated the practical dimension of this program, which gave us the chance to learn through concrete projects and professional simulations. The emphasis placed on object-oriented programming, for example, provided me with a solid foundation for understanding the principles of software design and structuring.
The teaching staff played an important role in this learning process. Overall, the lecturers were skilled and dedicated, successfully sharing their expertise through a variety of modules covering a broad spectrum of topics. These courses were spread over the three years of the degree, allowing for steady progress and continuous skill development. The modular structure also offered an overview of the different facets of computer science, ranging from development to deployment, including data management and software design.
The SAE (Situations d’Apprentissage et d’Évaluation – learning and assessment projects) were a key component of the program. These projects enabled us to put our knowledge into practice while also developing transversal skills such as teamwork, time management, and problem-solving. Among the most significant projects, I particularly remember the design of a web application using the Symfony framework. This project was especially enriching, as it combined the technical aspects of development with considerations of ergonomics and software architecture. We also had the opportunity to strengthen our knowledge of databases, through design and modeling, which helped us better understand their central role in most modern applications.
From a technical point of view, the program introduced us to several programming languages, such as Python, PHP, and JavaScript. The use of libraries and frameworks like React and Symfony added another dimension, immersing us in environments similar to those used in professional settings. These experiences allowed us to adapt to different development contexts and to broaden our versatility as future computer scientists.
The third year represented a turning point with the specialization in the DATA track. This orientation enabled us to acquire additional skills in data analysis and visualization, which are now essential in many sectors. This specialization opened new perspectives and gave me the opportunity to work on topics different from those usually encountered in traditional web development.
Nevertheless, some subjects proved to be more challenging. This was particularly the case for modules on Docker and UML-based software design, which required a higher level of abstraction and turned out to be complex for a large number of students. Although demanding, these challenges still offered an opportunity to progress by confronting us with more advanced and technical concepts.
Finally, regarding the DATA specialization, it is worth noting a slight gap between the expectations of the track and some of the subjects taught. A stronger focus on data science, with less emphasis on web development, would probably have been more consistent with the objectives of the specialization. Despite this, the track was highly valuable and provided me with skills that will be useful for both my academic path and future professional career.
