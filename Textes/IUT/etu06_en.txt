Looking back on my career before starting the Master's program, I can say that my experience in the Computer Science BUT program was a decisive step, both personally and professionally. Personally, I entered this program after obtaining my bachelor's degree specializing in Mathematics and Physics-Chemistry. At the time, I had absolutely no knowledge of computer science or programming. It was therefore a field that I completely discovered upon joining the BUT program. Very quickly, I realized that computer science had become a passion, particularly anything related to data, data manipulation, and data mining.

The first year allowed me to lay the foundations and discover the world of coding. The courses were tailored to beginners, which helped me progress without feeling lost. In particular, I discovered the Python language, which quickly became my favorite. I found this first approach to development very enriching, as it combined logic, rigor, and creativity. The academic support was generally good: the professors remained available and attentive to the students' difficulties. The class atmosphere was also very positive. The mutual support between classmates played an important role in my success and made the year all the more enjoyable.

At the same time, I learned databases, SQL, and UML, concepts that I immediately found fascinating. Understanding how to organize and structure information made me want to delve deeper into this field, which naturally led my choice of specialization to data management and exploitation.

However, this program also had its share of challenges. The pace of work was demanding, especially during projects and exam periods. It was necessary to be rigorous and organized to successfully balance everything. Some courses were sometimes too theoretical or poorly adapted, and some teachers lacked pedagogy, which complicated the understanding of certain topics. Despite these obstacles, I learned to adapt and persevere, which allowed me to gain independence and improve my work methods.

During my second and third years, I consolidated my technical skills through the Data Management, Administration, and Mining program. I deepened my mastery of SQL, discovered Power BI, and perfected my data analysis with Python. These years were also marked by the completion of real-life projects, which allowed me to apply my knowledge to real-life situations.

Finally, the internships I completed were particularly enriching. They provided me with a true immersion into the professional world and allowed me to understand the real-world challenges related to data in business. These experiences strengthened my ability to work in a team, solve real-life problems, and adapt to diverse contexts.

Overall, I have excellent memories of my BUT Computer Science program. I remember its constant progress, wonderful encounters, and solid skills development. Of course, some aspects could be improved, particularly the teaching methods of certain courses or the distribution of the workload. But overall, this training fully fulfilled its role: it gave me a solid foundation, a strong passion for DATA, and the motivation needed to pursue a Master's degree with confidence and ambition.
