Overall, I find the BUT Informatique Data course to be a really interesting and professional training programme. What I particularly appreciated was the importance given to practical experience and work experience. Between projects, tutorials and, above all, internships or work-study programmes, you learn to apply what you see in class in a practical way. This gives you a better understanding of how the professional world works and helps you develop skills that are directly useful. For me, this is clearly one of the programme's major strengths.

The lecturers are also very good overall. They know their field well, are committed and available when you need help. You can tell that they want you to progress and that they take the time to explain things. The fact that many of the courses are practice-oriented makes learning more lively and less theoretical. It's motivating to work on concrete projects rather than limiting yourself to abstract concepts.

However, not everything is perfect. There are still quite a few courses that I find useless or ill-suited to the programme's objectives. Some have little to do with computer science or data specialisation, and sometimes it feels like a waste of time. This ‘filler’ aspect of the programme is frustrating, especially when the workload is already very heavy.

And the volume of work is another difficult point. Between classes, projects, assignments, reports and personal work, you really have to be organised to get through it all. At times, it can be a bit overwhelming, especially when some tasks don't seem to contribute much to our learning. I have felt overwhelmed at times, which can be demotivating.

Despite everything, I still have a very positive opinion of the BUT Informatique Data course. It's a demanding programme, but it allows you to acquire real technical and professional skills. It opens many doors, whether you want to continue your studies or enter the world of work. If I had to do it again, I think I would make the same choice, hoping for just a little less useless coursework and a more balanced workload.
