What I mainly gained from this training were good working methods and an enriching experience of teamwork. Group projects allow us to compare our ideas, develop our sense of collaboration, and get closer to the real conditions of the professional world. These activities also encourage creativity and learning by doing, which is very useful in preparing for entry into the world of work. However, I would have appreciated more guided work sessions to explore certain concepts in greater depth and better prepare us for assessments. Mr. Fouchal's call for projects was a highlight, as it allowed us to discover the work of future doctoral students and gain a concrete insight into scientific research. The classroom atmosphere is pleasant and the students are generally serious and respectful. The content being developed is well structured and relevant, and some subjects allow for direct application of the skills acquired.The PHP material, for example, was particularly well organized: the classes were supplemented by practical assignments that allowed us to review the concepts covered in lectures, and the concrete project proposed by Mr. Rabat, in connection with a sports tournament organized by the faculty, made the work motivating and relevant. The introduction of RemoteLabz was also very interesting in terms of understanding virtualization and the importance of configuration files, as well as the problems associated with different possible architectures. However, there are some areas for improvement. Some teachers lack pedagogical involvement and clarity in their classes. For example, some do not take the time to explain the objectives, assessment methods, or the main focus of the subject. The imbalance in the weighting of subjects is also problematic: some, such as English, are given too much weight in relation to their actual usefulness, while others, such as the call for projects, are undervalued. English classes should focus more on vocabulary and professional situations, rather than on irrelevant logbooks. As for cybersecurity, teaching begins too late, in the second semester of the third year, which leaves little time to go into depth before the master's degree. The practical “red team” component, which helps students understand the vulnerabilities of applications and websites, is almost non-existent. When it comes to cybersecurity, teaching begins too late, in the second semester of the third year, which leaves little time to explore the subject in depth before the master's degree. The practical “red team” component, which helps students understand the vulnerabilities of applications and websites, is almost entirely absent. Some mathematics courses seem to lack practical relevance to the program, while others, such as Turing theory, which are essential, suffer from a lack of appeal and pedagogical approach. The C++ course was too condensed. A gradual approach, with an introduction in the first year and more in-depth study in the second year, would have been more effective, particularly for complex concepts such as addresses and pointers, which should be more intuitive and accessible to students. In addition, differences in the working environment between macOS, Windows, and Linux often lead to wasted time, particularly in L1 and L2. An introduction to containerization with Docker in the first year could have standardized the environments and simplified project configuration. The hardware conditions also need to be reviewed, as some rooms do not have enough electrical outlets, which complicates working on computers.Certain concepts, such as pseudo-code, do not seem directly useful, while topics that are highly relevant to the professional world, such as DevOps, are not covered sufficiently. Finally, paper assignments, which simply consist of reproducing what has been seen in class, seem to me to be less effective than practical, project-oriented assessments, which would better represent our skills and our ability to solve concrete problems. In summary, this training offers many advantages, particularly in terms of teamwork, concrete projects, and practical methods. However, it also has its limitations, particularly in the teaching of certain subjects, the organization of cybersecurity instruction, differences in work environments, and preparation for the real needs of the professional world. Despite these areas for improvement, the overall experience has been enriching and has given me a better understanding of my strengths, weaknesses, and the skills I need to develop for the rest of my career.
