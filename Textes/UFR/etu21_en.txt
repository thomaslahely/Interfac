I joined the University of Reims in 2022 to begin my Bachelor’s degree in Computer Science. This choice came naturally, as I have always had a strong interest in computers and new technologies. I saw this program as an opportunity to deepen my knowledge, explore different fields related to computer science, and most importantly, gradually prepare myself for professional life.

Throughout my studies, several subjects stood out. Algorithmics was an essential step for me, as it taught me to think in a structured and logical way when facing complex problems. Databases also had a significant impact, as I learned how to organize, manage, and manipulate information efficiently—a central aspect of many IT projects. Of course, some subjects seemed less useful at the time, but in hindsight, they still contributed to building a broader general knowledge.

Beyond the theoretical courses, the practical projects were very formative. I am particularly thinking of the web development projects supervised by Mr. Rabbat, which left a strong impression on me. These projects allowed me to move from theory to practice, by designing and developing websites, and experimenting with different working methods. It was precisely this type of real-world application that helped me progress the most.

I also had the opportunity to complete two internships during my Bachelor’s degree. The first one took place in my first year, and although it was a short and basic experience, it introduced me to the professional world. The second, completed in my third year, remains my favorite. I carried it out in a company specialized in creating websites. This internship was very valuable, as I was able to contribute to real projects aligned with my programming and web development skills. I also discovered the constraints and workflows of a company, which gave me a clearer picture of what my future career could look like.

Throughout the degree, I had teachers who left their mark on my journey—sometimes positively, sometimes less so. Some managed to transmit their passion and bring their subject to life, as was the case in the web projects. Others, like Mr. Valence, left a more mixed impression. But that is also part of the university experience: learning from the diversity of teaching approaches.

Looking back, I would say that this Bachelor’s degree has been an important step for me. It allowed me to strengthen my foundations in computer science, develop technical skills, and become familiar with different tools and programming languages. It also provided me with practical experiences, through projects and internships, that prepared me to move forward. Today, I see this program as a solid foundation that allows me to confidently consider the next step—continuing my studies with a Master’s degree, specializing in Artificial Intelligence.
