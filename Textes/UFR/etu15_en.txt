My previous degree was a Bachelor’s in Computer Science, which I completed at URCA, specifically within the Faculty of Exact and Natural Sciences. This degree was quite broad and covered many fields such as web development, databases, networks, statistics, programming, and general programming methods.

For me, the main positive aspect of this Bachelor’s program was precisely its diversity, which allowed students to explore different areas and later specialize in the one they found most appealing—whether for further study or for professional purposes. Another advantage was that many professors made their lecture slides available to us, which allowed us to focus on their explanations instead of trying to write everything down. Moreover, we had the same professors throughout the three years (most of whom were passionate and willing to help whenever needed), which contributed to a positive and consistent atmosphere during the entire program.

As for the aspects that could be improved, it is somewhat difficult to be specific since the curriculum was changed during the program. This modification caused some issues in the organization of certain subjects—for example, we sometimes studied advanced topics before learning the basics, or we had the same subject repeated in different years. Furthermore, the projects were often linked to a single subject and tended to be short-term. It would be interesting to have more interdisciplinary projects, such as the research project (TER) we did during the final semester, which encouraged a more global application of our skills. The database and systems courses also need revision, as there was significant overlap between the basic and advanced levels (same slides, same exercises). Additionally, the database practical sessions were sometimes too light, with very few exercises (for example, only five SQL queries to complete in two hours).

Finally, regarding the negative aspects, I believe that Mr. Valance Goery’s behavior should be addressed. He was often verbally aggressive toward students, closed to questions, and unwilling to offer help. He frequently stated that he would never change his teaching methods, even when students struggled, which affected both the quality of the course and the overall atmosphere.
It would also be worth reconsidering the level of difficulty of certain courses, which were often too challenging compared to the expected level—such as C programming in the second year or Turing machines in the third year—where the class average grades were often below 5/20.
